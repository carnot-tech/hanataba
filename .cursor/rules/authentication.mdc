# Authentication System

The application uses a social authentication system with GitHub as a provider.

## Key Components

- [app/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/page.tsx): Contains the sign-in button and user data display
- Authentication is handled through the auth client in [lib/auth-client.ts](mdc:src/lib/auth-client.ts)
- User data is fetched using the API client in [lib/client.ts](mdc:src/lib/client.ts)

## Authentication Flow

1. User clicks the "Sign in" button which triggers the GitHub OAuth flow
2. After successful authentication, user data can be fetched using the "Get me" endpoint
3. User information is stored in React state and displayed on the page

## API Integration

The application uses a typed API client for making authenticated requests to the backend:
- GET `/api/v1/users/me`: Fetches the current user's information
- Authentication state is managed through the `authClient` utility
