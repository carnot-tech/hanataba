# UI Components and Styling

The application uses Shadcn/ui for pre-built components and styling.

## Component System

- UI components are configured through [components.json](mdc:components.json)
- Base components are located in the components directory
- Components follow the Shadcn/ui styling conventions using Tailwind CSS

## Key UI Components

- [components/ui/button.tsx](mdc:components/ui/button.tsx): Button component used throughout the application
- Additional UI components can be added using the Shadcn/ui CLI

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS is used for styling
- PostCSS configuration in [postcss.config.mjs](mdc:postcss.config.mjs)
- Components use consistent theming and styling patterns from Shadcn/ui
